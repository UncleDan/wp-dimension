A configurable Wordpress Theme version of [HTML5up Dimension Theme](https://html5up.net/dimension) made for the internet by [@cogdog](http://cog.dog) (that link uses this theme!). WP-Dimension creates a simple, elegant calling card site you can host on your own domain, not park it in some ad-tracking About site.

WP-Dimension creates a site that looks like

The box links below the headings each open content overlays, each a Wordpress post, internally on the site renamed "Front Boxes": 

![Sample Page](images/sample-page.jpg "Sample Page")

Editing options in the posts/front pages provide the means to add a button and link at the bottom that can go to any URL. You can also create standalone WordPress pages in case you have more info than you want to show in a front box.

It's sure elegant, right?

## Installing from Scratch

Install this theme on any self hosted Wordpress site. You cannot do this on Wordpress.com, get a real web hosting package.

You can download a ZIP file of this theme via the green **Code*" button above (use the Download Zip option). 

The zip can be uploaded directly to your site via **Themes** in the Wordpress dashboard, then **Add Theme** and finally **Upload Theme**. If you run into size upload limits or just prefer going old school like me, unzip the package and ftp the entire folder into your `wp-content/themes` directory.

## Updating the Theme

As of WordPress version 5.5 themes uploaded as .ZIP files can now be updated the same way you installed it; just download the newest version, and update it  via **Themes** in the Wordpress dashboard, then **Add Theme** and finally **Upload Theme**. You will be asked to confirm updating the theme with the newer version.  

If you have ftp/sftp access to your site (or this can be done in a cpanel file manager), simply upload the new theme files to the `wp-content/themes` directory that includes the older version theme. 

## We Got Your Docs Right Here

See the documentation of WP-Dimension, how to customize your site, and other WordPress features included in the theme [now separated as it's own link here](https://github.com/cogdog/wp-dimension/blob/master/docs.md) but can also be viewed in a more readable format - [see the Docs!](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogdog/wp-dimension/master&homepage=docs.md&sidebar=true#/) (thanks to [Docsify This](https://docsify-this.net/)).
