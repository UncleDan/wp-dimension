A configurable Wordpress Theme version of [HTML5up Dimension Theme](https://html5up.net/dimension) made for the internet by [@cogdog](http://cog.dog) (that link uses this theme!). WP-Dimension creates a simple, elegant but super flexible calling card site you can host on your own domain, not park it in some ad-tracking About site.

WP-Dimension creates a site that looks like

Almost every thing beyond the boxes and menus, including the top icon and the background image can me modified with the WordPress Customizer. The optional social menu icon menu is enabled by installing the [Iconic Font Menus plugin](https://github.com/cogdog/font-awesome-5-menus) (another one made by moi).

The box links below the headings each open content overlays, each a Wordpress post, internally on the site renamed "Front Boxes": 

![Sample Page](images/sample-page.jpg "Sample Page")

Editing options in the posts/front pages provide the means to add a button and link at the bottom that can go to any URL. You can also create standalone WordPress pages in case you have more info than you want to show in a front box.

It's sure elegant, right?

## So You are Interested in Using WP-Dimension?

For inspiration I offer [a collection of other sites](examples.md) using this theme, then provide  [details on how to install it](install.md), and once set up, the [documentation](docs.md) for customizing it in WordPress (plus details on how to update). The  documentation is available in a more readable format - [see the Docs!](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogdog/wp-dimension/master&homepage=docs.md&sidebar=true#/) (thanks to [Docsify This](https://docsify-this.net/)).
